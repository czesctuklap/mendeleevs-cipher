# mendeleevs-cipher
A program that encrypts a given text in such a way that, instead of letters, the program outputs the atomic number of the element which chemical symbol corresponds to the encrypted letters, ignoring their case. The space between letters should be replaced with an asterisk, and the space between words should be replaced with two asterisks.
